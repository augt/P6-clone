# P6 - Piiquante

### Description :

This is the 6th project of my training program at OpenClassrooms. The goal was to build a **Node.js** back-end API for an imaginary website that allows people to share their reviews of spicy sauces. The front-end part of the code was already provided.

The database relies on **MongoDB**.

### Installation instructions :

- [ ] `Node.js` and `npm` must be installed locally on your machine.
- [ ] Clone the repo to your computer.
- [ ] In a terminal window, navigate to the `/backend` folder of the projet.
- [ ] Enter the command `npm install`.

- [ ] The application needs to be connected to a MongoDB database in order to work properly. You can connect your own database by modifying the `app.js` file in the `/backend` folder at line 10. Replace the areas starting with "<" and ending with ">" by the relevant data from your own database.

- [ ] Enter the command `node server` to launch the server.

- [ ] Open a second terminal window and navigate to the `/client` folder of the project.
- [ ] Enter the command `npm install`.
- [ ] Enter the command `npm start`.
- [ ] If a new browser tab doesn't open automatically, you can enter `http://localhost:8081/` in the address bar of your browser to launch the project.
